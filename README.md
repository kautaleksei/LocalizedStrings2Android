About LocalizedStrings2Android
==============================

LocalizedStrings2Android is a java program which converts iOS'
Localized.strings files to Android's native strings.xml format. It is useful
for developers who support multiple mobile client platforms and need to keep
the copy synchronized between them.

This program is still under construction and should be considered alpha
quality.
